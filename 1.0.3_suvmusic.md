# v1.0.3: The "Polished & Connected" Update

This release marks a significant milestone in UI/UX maturity and feature expansion. We've focused heavily on bridging the gap between platform aesthetics (Apple Music/Spotify inspirations), enhancing social connectivity (Comments, Sharing), and solidifying the "Super App" music experience with seamless integrations.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Spotify Playlist Import:** Migrated from closed beta. Users can now seamlessly import playlists directly from Spotify with detailed success/failure reporting.

    *   Full-fledged integration for Home Sections, Charts, and Trending data.
    *   Comprehensive Search support (Artists, Albums, Playlists).
    *   Synced Lyrics (via LRCLib) for all supported tracks.
    *   *Note: HQ Audio streaming is now gated behind Developer Mode for compliance.*
*   **Dynamic Island & MiniPlayer:**
    *   Added a fully interactive, floating "Dynamic Island" overlay with seekbar controls.
    *   Redesigned in-app MiniPlayer with a modern, floating card aesthetic (Spotify-inspired) and swipe gestures.
*   **Social & Community:**
    *   **Comments System:** View and post comments on tracks directly from the player menu.
    *   **Share Functionality:** Added `suvmusic://` deep linking and improved sharing logic for seamless cross-app song sharing.
    *   **Listening Stats:** New dashboard for tracking top songs and artists over time.
*   **Playback Experience:**
    *   **Endless Queue (Radio Mode):** Automatically fetches recommendations when the queue ends.
    *   **Video Mode:** Toggle between Audio-only and Video playback for YouTube tracks.
    *   **Offline Mode:** Dedicated toggle and storage management to strictly play local/downloaded content.

    *   Implemented "Glass" material design for dialogs (Update, Developer Access).

*   **Gestures:**
    *   Added vertical swipe volume controls.
    *   Improved swipe-to-dismiss interactions for the player view.
